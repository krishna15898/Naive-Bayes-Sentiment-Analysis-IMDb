# Sentiment-Analysis-IMDb
Sentiment classification of IMDb reviews of movies into two classes - positive and negative. I have used Naive Bayes with Laplace smoothing. I have also done some feature engineering by - removing stop words, making phrases of pairs of words, and adding long words (assuming they mean much more and should have larger weightage in the classification.)
